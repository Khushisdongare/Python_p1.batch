    Block vs Inline Elements:
    - Block elements (like <div>, <p>, <article>) start on a new line and take up the full width available.
    - Inline elements (like <span>, <a>, <strong>) do not start on a new line and only take up as much width as needed.

  <!-- Block-level div with a red paragraph inside -->
  <div>
    <p class="red-text">This is a paragraph inside a div, and it is red.</p>
  </div>

  <!-- Paragraph with an inline span highlighting a word in blue -->
  <p>
    This sentence contains a <span class="blue-word">highlighted</span> word.
