  <h1>CSS Text Alignment Demonstration</h1>

  <div>
    <p class="left">This paragraph is aligned to the left.</p>
    <p class="center">This paragraph is aligned to the center.</p>
    <p class="right">This paragraph is aligned to the right.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="note">
    <strong>Note:</strong> The difference between <strong>justify</strong> and <strong>center</strong> is that
    <em>justify</em> aligns text evenly along both left and right margins, adding spacing between words if necessary,
    while <em>center</em> places the entire line of text in the center without adjusting word spacing.
